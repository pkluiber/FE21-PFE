    <p class="myP pt-2">
        The first Sony PlayStation: how it all began PlayStation 2: The best-selling game console to date PlayStation Portable: Sony's first mobile game console PlayStation 3: The first Sony console with Blu-Ray drive and online gaming PS Vita: The last mobile
        console in PlayStation history to date PlayStation 4: blockbuster among console gamers The new PS5: will the console make PlayStation history? On December 3, 1994, the first PlayStation saw the light of day in far away Japan. It became one of
        the most successful game consoles worldwide and marked the beginning of a success story. </p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">
        We take the release of the PlayStation 5 as an opportunity to take a closer look at the history of the PlayStation and look at the milestones of the 26 years. Are you ready for some gaming history? Let's go.
    </p>


    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">The first Sony PlayStation: how it all began</h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">To this day, the manufacturers of game consoles vie for the favor of gamers. The competition is tough - and it has been for Sony from the start. Originally, the manufacturer did not want to bring its own game console onto the market, but only presented
        a CD-ROM drive for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) in 1991. At the time, however, Nintendo let the deal fall through, motivating Sony to develop its own game console.</p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">


        Three years later, the PlayStation premiered in Japan and finally came to Europe and the USA in September 1995. With a built-in CD-ROM drive, of course. The new medium had more storage space, so that the games could become more and more extensive. And
        last but not least, it was the graphics, which were impressive for the time, that were partly responsible for the success of the first PlayStation. After all, the new console brought 3D worlds to the gamer's tube TV for the first time.

    </p>

    <p class="myP pt-2">

        The most successful titles from the first PlayStation include today's classics "Ridge Racer" from 1994, "Tomb Raider" and "Crash Bandicoot" from 1996 and "Gran Turismo" from 1997.

    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">
        PlayStation 2: The best-selling game console to date </h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">
        The new millennium was just a few weeks old, the year 2000 problem (also: Millennium bug; PC problems caused by the turn of the year) was over, and spring in Japan brought forth the second generation of PlayStation as well as sprouting plants. And in
        contrast to many a film series, the second chapter of PlayStation history has once again surpassed the original. Because the PlayStation 2 (PS2) is the best-selling game console worldwide with over 155 million copies.
    </p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">

        On the one hand, this could be due to the even more detailed graphics or the vibrating Dualshock 2 controllers, but to a certain extent also to the DVD drive. Because instead of simply streaming films, rotating discs were still placed in the compartment
        of a DVD player. These devices were initially quite expensive. So we were delighted at the time that the new console also included this home cinema function for watching movies, so to speak. </p>

    <p class="myP pt-2">
        Not to be forgotten, of course, are the now legendary games such as “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas” (2001) and “Sing Star” from 2004 and “God of War” from 2005.</p>

    <img class="history" src="/images/playstation-2.jpg" alt="">

    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">
        PlayStation Portable: Sony's first mobile game console</h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">How do you build a mobile game console? It's very simple: Take a PlayStation controller, stretch it a bit, put a display in the middle and name the resulting piece of technology PlayStation Portable (PSP). With around 81 million copies sold worldwide,
        the PSP is now the 10th best-selling game consoles. It probably owes this to the Grand Theft Auto part "Liberty Stories", which initially appeared exclusively for the PSP and which you could even play with several players.</p>

    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">
        PlayStation 3: The first Sony console with Blu-Ray drive and online gaming </h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">For the third PlayStation, Sony has again turned the equipment screw. In 2006, the PlayStation 3 appeared in Japan and the United States; in spring 2007 also in Europe. New on board the PS3 were a Blu-Ray drive, internal hard drive and, last but not
        least, online functionality. With them you could, among other things, gamble with and against your friends over the Internet. The PlayStation Network of course also has other facets. You could watch movies, listen to music, or watch TV. Another
        novelty of the PS3 that is absolutely normal from today's perspective: wireless controllers. The new Dualshock-3 only needed to charge-Controller a cable and otherwise you have moved freely in the reception area.</p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">
        Games like “Little Big Planet” from 2008 and “The Last of Us” and “Grand Theft Auto V” from 2013 are among the most played games on the PlayStation 3.</p>
    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">
        PS Vita: The last mobile console in PlayStation history to date</h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">Although the PlayStation Vita cut a really good figure on paper, it didn't really convince the fans. Nevertheless, it went over the counter a million times. Because as early as 2012, a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, two sticks and a touchpad on the back
        were part of the equipment.
    </p>

    <p class="myP pt-2">Over 1,500 games offer a wide range of mobile gaming fun, including “Gravity Rush” from 2012 as well as “Killzone Mercenary” and “Tearaway”, both of which appeared on PS Vita in 2013.</p>

    <img class="history" src="/images/ps3.png" alt="">

    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">PlayStation 4: blockbuster among console gamers</h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">So far, the PlayStation 4 was the current Sony console and has already been sold over 113 million times. Dualshock 4 controllers, virtual reality or the PlayStation Now streaming service are just a few of the features that console gamers appreciate
        on the PS4. As usual, the console was first launched in Japan in 2013 and was released in the US and Europe in 2014.</p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">On the PlayStation 4 you get all the popular top games served, including milestones and classics such as "Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End" from 2016 or "Horizon Zero Dawn" and "Gran Turismo Sport" from 2017.</p>

    <img class="history" src="/images/ps4h.jpg" alt="">
    <h2 class="myH2 mt-5">
        The new PS5: will the console make PlayStation history?</h2>
    <p class="myP pt-2">The next chapter in the history of the PlayStation starts now, because the PlayStation 5 is in the starting blocks. It will be available from November 19th and in just a few weeks it will show whether it can build on the successful history of its
        predecessors. There is a lot to be said for this in advance. Apart from the support for 4K Blu-Rays, the PlayStation 5 also has a Zen-2 processor with eight cores from AMD and a graphics unit that also supports hardware ray tracing. This means
        that the PS5 has a lot of power under the hood to herald the next generation of consoles.</p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">On featured we tell you everything about the games, release, technology, price and more for the PlayStation 5.</p>

    <p class="myP pt-2">Sony has also come up with a few exciting innovations for the controller. The gamepad, dubbed Dualsense, should give haptic feedback and vary the resistance of the analog trigger.</p>
    <p class="myP pt-2">In any case, we are excited about the PS5 and what the next chapter in PlayStation history will bring.</p>
